# Your exercise here:

# TODO:
#   Display your understanding of the ruby way by showing us a refactoring.
#   Add some code that lost its author some karma, but that could be fixed inside 30 minutes,
#   Commit that code to the repo,
#   Add a test or spec that exercises the code, and passes,
#   Refactor the code in a way that gains you karma, and commit it over the top of the old code.

# Your code goes here...
