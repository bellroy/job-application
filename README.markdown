TrikeApps coding exercises
===

There are several files in this repo. They're all missing something. There is
karma to be gained by adding the thing that is missing.

TODO:
---

1. Clone this repo (don't fork it).
2. Change each of the files, adding what is needed (sometimes adding new files
   will be needed, some of which may end in `_test.rb` or `_spec.rb`), committing
   your changes to your local repo when The Way requires that you do.
3. Zip up your modified repo and email it to jobs@trikeapps.com.

Note that tests, specs, and clear commit messages all bring good karma.
